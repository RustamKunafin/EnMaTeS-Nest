description: "Schema Migration v3: Introduce 'alias', canonical UUIDs for MUIDs, and ensure all 'link' relations have an 'LID'."
operations:
  # --- Step 1: Add 'alias' field to all nodes ---
  - action: add_node_field
    params:
      field_name: "alias"
      default_value: ""

  # --- Step 2: Copy old textual MUIDs to 'alias' ---
  - action: copy_field

  # --- Step 3: Replace old MUIDs with new canonical UUIDs ---

  # --- Step 4: Ensure all existing 'link' relations have an LID ---
  # This guarantees that even old relations, which existed before LID was introduced, get their ID.
  - action: add_lid_to_links

  # --- Step 5: Update relation endpoints to use new node MUIDs (UUIDs) ---
  # This is necessary because Step 3 changes node MUIDs, and relations must reference the new MUIDs.
