Membra Open Development License (MODL) v1.0
Copyright (c) Rustam Kunafin 2025. All rights reserved.

1. **Grant of Rights**
   - You are granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the Membra core artifacts (methodologies, frameworks, semantic graphs, prompts) for any purpose, including commercial use, provided you comply with this license.

2. **Attribution**
   - You must give appropriate credit to the original author (Rustam Kunafin, https://cyberries.org), provide a link to this license, and indicate if changes were made. This preserves Membra as the "source of truth."

3. **Derivative Works with Membra DNA**
   - You may create derivative works (e.g., specialized versions or add-ons) based on Membra core artifacts.
   - Derivatives may be distributed under any license of your choice (including proprietary), but must acknowledge Membra as the conceptual foundation and include a reference to this MODL (e.g., "Based on Membra, licensed under MODL v1.0, https://cyberries.org/04_Resources/0440_Agreements/MODL").
   - Optionally, share derivatives openly (e.g., via smart contracts on decentralized platforms) to contribute to the Membra ecosystem.

4. **Preservation of Original**
   - The original Membra core artifacts must remain unchanged in their canonical form and be accessible (e.g., at https://cyberries.org/).
   - Contributions to core artifacts must be submitted to the original repositories (e.g., EnMaTeS-Nest) for review and integration.

5. **Evolving License**
   - This license may be updated by the author to reflect Membraâ€™s evolution (e.g., new methodologies, decentralized governance). Updates will be versioned (e.g., MODL v1.1) and published at https://cyberries.org/04_Resources/0440_Agreements/MODL. Existing users may continue under the version they accepted, but integration of new core artifact updates requires adherence to the latest MODL version to access enhanced features and community support.

6. **Decentralized Development**
   - The author may introduce a decentralized governance model (e.g., DAO) where roles, access levels, and contributions are managed via smart contracts. This license will adapt accordingly.

7. **Disclaimer**
   - This work is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. The author is not liable for any damages arising from its use.
